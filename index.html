        <h3>What can I do with my USDT?</h3>
        <p>
          You can use your coins to pay for goods or services. An increasing
          number of small merchants and large businesses are now accepting USDT
          payments. Looking for fiat or other cryptocurrencies? No problem,
          there are dozens of exchanges which allow you to trade your USDT for
          fiat currencies (USD, EUR etc.) or other cryptocurrencies. Apart from
          that, you can also hold onto it as each USDT is meant to maintain a
          stable value relative to 1 US dollar.
        </p>
        <h3>What is USDT?</h3>
        <p>
          USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency with tokens issued by Tether
          Limited. It formerly claimed that each token was backed by one United
          States dollar, but on 14 March 2019 changed the backing to include
          loans to affiliate companies. The cryptocurrency is meant to mirror
          the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable
          cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve
          this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called "stable
          coins". According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital
          currency, to anchor or "tether" the value of the coin to the price of
          national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Tether
          is issued on the Omni, TRON, and ETH blockchains.
